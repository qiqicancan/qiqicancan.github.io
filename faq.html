                English is not my mother tongue. I am using Google Translate to communicate with you.

            <p>
                Please understand the inaccurate expression.

                Will my information be submitted to you?
            </p>
            <p style="font:bolder; font-size:larger;">
                will not. When you open the homepage, the code required for encryption / decryption has been downloaded to your device. Internet is no longer required for all operations and no information will be submitted to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            </p>
            <p>
                Is your encryption algorithm unbreakable?
            </p>
            <p style="font:bolder; font-size:larger;">
                Certainly not.
                It was completely designed by me and has a certain complexity. For ordinary thieves, there is no ready-made cracking method. Can deal with conventional theft.
                It is safe when there are not many users. When there are too many users to study it, I will introduce different encryption algorithms.(the old algorithm will be retained)
                When multiple encryption algorithms with unobvious characteristics exist at the same time, the cost of cracking will be high.
                (Remark: When you are targeted by a professional team, it may not protect your secret)
            </p>

            <p>
                Will your tools stay updated?
            </p>
            <p style="font:bolder; font-size:larger;">
                Even if I say yes, smart you will assume that I will not. The encryption / decryption tool provided on the homepage is written in JavaScript (a general web scripting language). Even if my website and I disappeared, you can save it and use it in any browser at any time.
